#Hangman Part 3
#Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left
#Keep track of the letters the user guessed.
#If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again

Potential Improvements:
- Check if choosen word can be guessed in 6 tries, if not pick a new word
- Make sure user guess is actually a letter
- Make sure if user puts lower case letter it recognizes it
